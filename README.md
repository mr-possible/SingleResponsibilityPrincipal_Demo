# SingleResponsibilityPrincipal_Demo

Hi everyone.
In this project, I have demonstrated the very concept of 'Single Responsibility Principal' and how it should be used for effective test automation.
I have demonstrated a very basic scenario of a simple google search. If someone is pulling this repo, please look out for the project structure also. It is created so as to simplify
the readability and approach of the code.

Also, I have used IntelliJ IDE for this product, and the browser used here is chrome (as per the commited code).
One more point to keep a note of is that, the chromedriver version used was latest on the date of the creation of this file, i.e. 13/08/2020. If somebody faces any issue regarding
the same (such as test failure due to version compatibility issues), please consider upgrading the chromedriver version and placing it in the desired place (where the older one
would have been located).

At last, I always welcome any kind of constructive criticism. :)
Bye.
