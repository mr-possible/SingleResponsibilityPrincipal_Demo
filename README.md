# Single Responsibility Principle in Test Automation Framework

In this project, I have demonstrated the very concept of 'Single Responsibility Principle' and how it can be used as a best practice while designing a test automation framework.<br />

I have used a very basic scenario of a simple google search to demonstrate the SRP.<br />

## What is Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) ? 

The idea behind the SRP is that every class, module, or function in a program should have <b>one responsibility/purpose</b> in a program. As a commonly used definition, "every class should have only one reason to change".<br />
